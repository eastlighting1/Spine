# Security Policy

Spine is still an early-stage library. The project skeleton and a meaningful portion of the surrounding scaffolding were established through vibe-coding-style iteration, then tightened with tests, validation rules, packaging checks, and documentation review. That means we want security feedback, correctness feedback, and hardening suggestions early and often.

## Reporting A Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue in Spine, please avoid posting full exploit details, secrets, tokens, or private infrastructure information in public.

For most reports in this repository, GitHub-native collaboration is preferred:

- open a GitHub issue for suspected weaknesses, unsafe behavior, missing validation, packaging concerns, or dependency-risk findings that are safe to discuss publicly,
- open a pull request if you already have a concrete hardening fix, test, or documentation update,
- use the repository security reporting channel if it is enabled for anything sensitive that should not be disclosed publicly yet.

When filing an issue, PR, or private report, include:

- a short description of the issue,
- affected versions or commit range,
- reproduction steps or proof of concept,
- potential impact.

If you are unsure whether something is a security bug or a correctness bug, open an issue anyway and mark it clearly as a suspected security concern.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are expected to target the most recent development line first. Older versions may not receive backported fixes unless explicitly stated.

## Disclosure Process

After a report is received, the maintainers will aim to:

1. acknowledge receipt,
2. validate the report,
3. prepare a fix or mitigation,
4. document the change in release notes when appropriate.
